This real time plotter requires the listener from: https://github.com/devinaconley/arduino-plotter
EDIT: Make sure to download the listener.java as well as it contains the changes that allows the listener to write to a file

These threads were useful in trouble shooting issues I had:
https://github.com/devinaconley/arduino-plotter/issues/37
https://github.com/devinaconley/arduino-plotter/issues/42

One of the issues I ran into is that the listener.exe on the github didn't work.
To fix this I recompiled the source files using Processing v4.3 (processing.org), I think I also had to download Java.

To compile the source in Processing:
1. Open the listener source file in Processing.
2. Save the sketch
3. Click File
4. Click export application
This should create a new folder in the listener source file.
In this folder should be a source.exe which is the listener for the project.

To run the code I would upload the hall-effect sensor arduino code to the ardiunio. (this is in the arduino IDE v2.3.2) 
Then I would open the source.exe.
I would then reupload the code.
For some reason this was the only way I found which worked consistently.

Things which do not work:
1. Uploading the code and then opening the listener. The listener gets stuck looking for COM6 and doesn't graph anything. Curiously,
pressing the button on the arduino to reset it doesn't cause the listener to work but pressing the button while the listener is connected 
does causes it to reset just fine.
2. Opening the listener and then uploading the code for the 1st time or after making changes. If the code hasn't been uploaded it doesn't 
start, but if it has been changed the unchanged code will run if it wasn't uploaded before the listener was opened.

Even when it works I get the error message:
avrdude: ser_open(): can't open device "\\.\COM6": Access is denied.
Failed uploading: uploading error: exit status 1

Best of luck if that doesn't work.
